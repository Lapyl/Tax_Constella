## Inspiration

After an initial reluctance, governments are now diving into blockchain, cryptocurrency, metagraph, and Hypergraph technologies. Taxation is one area where governments generate a revenue, and have little or no problem in spending money for a new technology. We felt that Constellation Network's technology has an immense potential in the taxation area. Unlike tax returns, tax registrations are generally public, and hence, government tax agencies need not worry about confidentiality while metagraphing tax registrations.  

## What it does

This project demonstrates a metagraph that can be used by government tax agencies for creating tax registration forms and by taxpayers for submitting such forms. The form template shows a typical multi-choice option. The project has built an online input form within a custom dashboard, whereby a DAG holder can transfer some DAG amount to another DAG holder.

The project's front-hand is hosted at clinos.us with an external web-hosting. The project's back-end is hosted at taxai.us with our in-house MacMini Server. This arrangement makes the front-end 24x7 and back-end affordable. 

## How we built it

After considering several possible application areas, we decided to focus on the taxation area. We then found that the tax registration aspect is the best to start with.

We installed Euclid SDK on a few of our computers. We tried to fuse different aspects from different metagraph examples. In view of time limits, we kept only a single setup (on MacMini Server) and a single metagraph template (voting poll example).

By forwarding ports as necessary, we make localhost links available on the Internet.  We then created a front-end website to assemble these links.  

## Challenges we ran into

We ran into several problems related to the compatibility of operating systems, Dockers, and required software. Stabilizing the entire setup was quite challenging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we can now build such setups for other potential users.

## What we learned

We learned Constellation Network's technology, concepts related to this technology, and software and tools needed for it.

## What's next for Tax Constella

We will improve the metagraph to make it more acceptable for tax registrations.

This repository contains developer_dashboard and sample_ui folders, which are slighly different form these folders in Constellation Network's repository.

This repository does not contain other folders, which are same as in Constellation Network's repository.
